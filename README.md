# navicat-keygen

[中文版README](README.zh-CN.md)

This repository will tell you how Navicat offline activation works.

Previous previous code is archived in [`windows-archived`](https://notabug.org/doublesine/navicat-keygen/src/windows-archived) branch for the reason that previous previous code contains 3rd binary libraries and it gets quite big :-(

Previous code is archived in [`windows-archived2`](https://notabug.org/doublesine/navicat-keygen/src/windows-archived2) branch for the reason that Navicat has come to version 16.x.x which I think should be a milestone and I decide to obsolete previous code and rewrite new one.

When you git-clone this repo, please add `--single-branch` flag so that archived branches won't be cloned to your computer, which saves your time and disk.

```console
$ git clone -b windows --single-branch https://notabug.org/doublesine/navicat-keygen.git
```
