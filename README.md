# navicat-keygen

[中文版README](README.zh-CN.md)

This repository will tell you how Navicat offline activation works.

Previous code is archived in [`windows-archived`](https://github.com/DoubleLabyrinth/navicat-keygen/tree/windows-archived) branch for the reason that previous code contains 3rd binary libraries and it gets quite big :-(



When you git-clone this repo, please add `--single-branch` flag so that archived branch won't be cloned to your computer, which saves your time and disk.

```console
$ git clone -b windows --single-branch https://github.com/DoubleLabyrinth/navicat-keygen.git
```
